synopsis:       Pretty printing designed for printing source code.
description:    Pretty printing designed for printing source code based on
		Wadler's paper /A Prettier Printer/. The main advantage of this
		library is its ability to automatically track the source
		locations associated with pretty printed values and output
		appropriate #line pragmas and its ability to produce output
                in the form of lazy text using a builder.
